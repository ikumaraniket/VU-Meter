We wanted to make something that is really useful in our day to day life. We all know how much we listen to music every day so we came up with something which will give us a mesmerizing experience while listening to your favorite music. We can consider the Volume Meter as an Equalizer, which is present in the Music systems. In which we can see the dancing of lights (LEDs) according to the music, if the music is loud, equalizer reaches to its peak and in low music it remains Low.

We have also built a Volume Meter or VU meter, with the help of LM3914 IC, which glows the LEDs as per strength of the sound, if sound is low, lesser LEDs will glow, and if sound is High more LEDs will glow.

VU meter serves as a volume measurement device. LM3914 based LED VU Meter is very simple and effective. Looks great when in action. It runs from 9v to 12v power supply. So in Nutshell, when there is sound, the LM3914 comparator voltmeter glow the LEDs according to the strength to the given signal. Hence we have sound measuring instrument, and so VOLUME METER.
